//! WebTransport is a protocol for client-server communication over QUIC.
//! It's [available in the browser](https://caniuse.com/webtransport) as an alternative to HTTP and WebSockets.
//!
//! WebTransport is layered on top of HTTP/3 which is then layered on top of QUIC.
//! This crate implements that layering on top of [s2n-quic](https://github.com/aws/s2n-quic),
//! exposing an API that mirrors the other `web-transport-*` backends and implements
//! the [`web_transport_trait`] interface.
//!
//! # Limitations
//! Like the other backends in this workspace, this crate does the bare minimum to support a
//! single WebTransport session that owns the entire QUIC connection. It does not support
//! pooling multiple sessions (or HTTP/3) over the same connection.
//!
//! s2n-quic differs from Quinn in a few ways that affect this crate:
//!   - TLS is configured via a [`s2n_quic::provider::tls::Provider`]; we build one from rustls.
//!   - Streams have no priority knob, so [`SendStream::set_priority`] is a no-op.
//!   - Datagram support requires the (unstable) default datagram provider, enabled here.
